Welcome to my homepage! Here, you can explore my research in high-energy physics, with a focus on Quark Gluon Plasma.

## 🔬 Research Overview

My work is closely related to experiments at the Brookhaven Heavy-ion facility (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at [CERN](http://www.cern.ch). I study the physics of strongly interacting matter at high temperatures and extreme energy densities, particularly the [Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark-gluon_plasma).

## 🎯 Research Focus
