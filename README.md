## Research

My work has been closely related to the experiments at the Brookhaven Heavy-ion facility(RHIC) and the Large Hardron Collider (LHC, with the different domain of energy compared with [http://www.bnl.gov/rhic RHIC]) at [http://www.cern.ch CERN]. My main interest was to study the physics of strongly interacting matter at high temperatures and extreme energy densities, where the formation of a new phase of matter, the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark-gluon_plasma Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP)], is expected.
