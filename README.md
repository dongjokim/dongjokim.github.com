# DongJo Kim's Research and Projects

Welcome to my homepage! Here, you can explore my research in high-energy physics, with a focus on Quark Gluon Plasma. Stay updated with my latest projects and findings.

## Research Overview

My work is closely related to experiments at the Brookhaven Heavy-ion facility (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at [CERN](http://www.cern.ch). I am particularly interested in studying the physics of strongly interacting matter at high temperatures and extreme energy densities, where the formation of a new phase of matter, the [Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark-gluon_plasma), is expected.
